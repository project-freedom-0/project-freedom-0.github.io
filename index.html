People stay awake for days ahead of their medical screening, do a lot of illegal drugs, or otherwise make themselves appear generally unhealthy to avoid being draft.</li>

    <div class = "caption"><b>Draft Calculator</b></div>
    <h3><center>How the draft was calculated:</center></h3>
    <center><p class = "text">The draft is essentially a lottery that determines if you are going to Vietnam to fight in war. Almost everyday, a number from 1 through 366 is chosen from a plastics basket with a spinner. Each number represented a different day of the year, including leap years, which is why there are 366 numbers. It is predicted that the amount of times they are going to choose a number from the draft is 195. With this information, we can calculate the probability that someone is going to be drafted.</p></center>
    <center><p class = "text">Since we are dealing with large numbers, it would be easier to find the probability of someone not getting drafted, and use that number to find the probability of someone getting drafted. So the probability you wouldn’t have been chosen the first time they chose a draft number was 365/366, since you have only one draft number out of the 366. The next time they choose a draft number, you would have a 364/365 chance of not getting chosen, since once a draft number was chosen, it couldn’t be chosen ever again. Repeating this process 195 times, you will end up with 365/366 * 364/365 * 363/364 * ... * 171/172, which ends up being 171/366. That is the probability that you wouldn’t be chosen, so to calculate the probability you would be chosen you would just calculate: 1 - (171/366) which ends up being <b>195/366</b>. </p></center>
    <center><p class = "text">Because the number wasn’t generated by a computer, and the capsules were arranged by humans and the number was chosen by a human, there was some human error when choosing the draft number. According to the statics from the graph below, you can see that if you were born in one of the first few months, you would have a higher chance of getting chose rather than people being chosen in the last few months </p></center>

  <center><p class = "text">In Vietnam the soldiers experienced many terrible things, among them the Vietcong’s crazy guerrilla war tactics. One major defense strategy of the Vietcong are bobby traps, these lethal traps were concealed under foliage in the dense Vietnam forest making them virtually invisible to the average U.S soldier. A common trap was the Punji stick trap, which consisted of sharpened bamboo sticks at the bottom of a hole covered by a thin frame with foliage on top. The unsuspecting soldier would step on the frame, therefore breaking it and falling into the spikes below, which were often covered with infection substances.</p></center>

  <center><p class = "text" class = "notbold"></b>In the harsh war torn enviroment of Vietnam there is another vile trap lurking in the jungle, the rolling trap. The trap is covered with foliage just like the Punji trap, so when the soldiers would unknowingly step on the trap they would fall down onto rotating spikes that spun when the soldier fell onto them.</center>
